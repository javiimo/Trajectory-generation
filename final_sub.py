    """Computes the trajectory of the car by iteratively finding the midpoint between the next right and left cones.

    This function calculates the car's trajectory based on the positions of right and left cones. It iteratively identifies the next right or left cones and computes the midpoint between them. This midpoint serves as the next point in the trajectory. The algorithm considers the distances between cones to determine which cone to select next, ensuring a smooth and accurate trajectory.

    The function also handles cases where one side (right or left) has more cones than the other. In such scenarios, it continues to follow the remaining cones until all cones have been considered.

    Args:
        right_points (list): A list of coordinates representing the right cones. Already in order
        left_points (list): A list of coordinates representing the left cones. Already in order

    Returns:
        list: A list of coordinates representing the computed trajectory.

    Algorithm:
        1. Order the right and left cones based on proximity and a dividing line defined by the first points of each list.
        2. Add the midpoint of the first right and left cones as the starting point of the trajectory.
        3. Iterate until all cones on either side have been considered:
            a. Calculate the distances between the current midpoint and the next right and left cones.
            b. Select the side (right or left) with the shorter distance.
            c. Compute the slope between the selected new last cone and the previous cone on the same side.
            d. Calculate the perpendicular slope to the computed slope.
            e. Find the intersection point between the line defined by the computed slope and the last midpoint, and the line defined by the perpendicular slope and the new last cone.
            f. Add the intersection point as the next point in the trajectory.
            g. Make sure the cone is exactly 1.5m away from the new last cone (This hyperparameter comes from the minimum width of the track being 3m)
            h. Use the clockwise and counterclockwise computation to make sure right cones are always to the right and left cones are always to the left. If not, rotate 180ยบ respect to the new last cone.
            i. Make sure the mid point list is ordered, no going forward and backward suddenly
            j. To prevent erratic trajectories on wider track sections, we average trajectory points that are less than 2 meters apart.
                -This helps avoid excessively close trajectory points.
                -However, this approach might be problematic if numerous cones are clustered together.
                -A potential alternative could involve skipping the averaging step for 2 or 3 consecutive iterations. Or using the info of the distance between cones of the same side.
        4. Return the list of trajectory points.

        Note:
            - This algorithm can work with just 2 cones from only one side and uses the information of all the cones registered from both sides to improve the predicted trajectory if more cones are given. But it strongly relies on distinguishing perfectly between right and left cones, if it missunderstands that, it will almost for sure get out of the track.
            
            - There are 2 hyperparameters that depend on the expected separation of the cones and the size of the vehicle, which are the thresholds of stepts g and j
